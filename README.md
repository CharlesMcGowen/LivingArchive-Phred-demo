## 🟣 Focus Project: [Phred](https://github.com/ChickenPwny/PhishingRetrievalEmailDetection)

Step into the frontline of email security innovation.

**Phred** isn’t just another email phishing detection suite—it’s a next-generation, sponsor-supported security awareness and simulation platform designed to help organizations proactively defend against sophisticated phishing threats.

### Key Features:
- **Sophisticated Phishing Campaign Simulation:** Launch customizable campaigns with realistic templates, targeting employees by department, region, or risk profile.
- **Targeted Anti-Phishing Training:** Automatically enroll users who fall for simulated attacks into engaging, interactive training modules.
- **Actionable Reporting & Analytics:** Real-time dashboards and downloadable reports reveal click rates, risk areas, and training outcomes.
- **Integration-Ready:** Seamlessly integrates with SMTP, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365.
- **Rapid Onboarding:** Get started in hours—not weeks—whether you’re a small business or a global enterprise.
- **Granular Segmentation:** Organize and target employees for precise, effective simulation and reporting.

Phred delivers much more than basic awareness—it’s an operational cyber defense platform built for modern defenders, incident responders, and compliance teams.
