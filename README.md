## 🛑 Current Status: Pre-Seed Seeding Phase

Phred is currently seeking **$10,000 in Strategic Capital** to move from Demo to Production.

Because our architecture is **Pay-Per-Request (AWS Serverless)**, our running costs are incredibly low ($0.21/user). However, we require upfront capital for:

- **Infrastructure Setup:** Secure SMTP relays and DKIM-signed domain authority.
- **Legal Compliance:** LLC formation and "Pilot Program" liability frameworks.
- **Core Development:** Completing the AI-powered "Reply Chain" engine.

## 💰 How to Sponsor Phred

If you are a business looking for a low-cost alternative to KnowBe4 ($3.00/seat), consider becoming a **Seeding Partner**:

- **$2,500 - Founding Partner:** Logo on the site + 1 year of "Locked-in" pricing.
- **$5,000 - Pilot Partner:** Get the Dockerized code to run simulations on your own internal network today.

## 🛠️ Local Technical Evaluation

If you want to see how Phred handles the "Logic" without the cloud, you can run the demo agent locally:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Ensure Docker is installed.
3. Run:

```bash
chmod +x start_demo.sh
./start_demo.sh
```

This will spin up the local callback agent and simulate the campaign flow you see on the dashboard.
