## 🟣 Focus Project: [Phred](https://github.com/ChickenPwny/PhishingRetrievalEmailDetection)

Step into the frontline of email security innovation.

**Phred** isn’t just an email phishing detection suite—it’s an advanced security awareness and simulation platform designed to help organizations proactively defend against sophisticated phishing threats.

### Key Features:
- **Sophisticated Phishing Campaign Simulation:** Launch customizable campaigns with realistic templates, targeting employees by department, region, or risk profile.
- **Targeted Anti-Phishing Training:** Automatically enroll users who fall for simulated attacks into engaging, interactive training modules.
- **Actionable Reporting & Analytics:** Real-time dashboards and downloadable reports reveal click rates, risk areas, and training outcomes.
- **Integration-Ready:** Seamlessly integrates with SMTP, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365.
- **Rapid Onboarding:** Get started in hours—not weeks—whether you’re a small business or a global enterprise.
- **Granular Segmentation:** Organize and target employees for precise, effective simulation and reporting.

Phred offers more than awareness—it’s an operational platform for defenders, responders, and compliance teams.
